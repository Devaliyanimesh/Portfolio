                                I'm a passionate and experienced Frontend Developer with hands-on expertise in building scalable, modular applications using Microfrontend architecture. Currently, Iâ€™m working at a product-based company where I focus on developing modern, high-performance web interfaces using Svelte.js. I have a strong command of core frontend technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React, and Svelte. My experience spans both UI/UX-focused development and component-driven architecture. I'm also familiar with backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and NestJS, which gives me a solid understanding of full-stack application flows. With a problem-solving mindset and attention to detail, I enjoy working on challenging projects that demand clean code, performance optimization, and seamless user experiences.
